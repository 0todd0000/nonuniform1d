# nonuniform1d
Functions and scripts for testing random field theory predictions regarding nonuniformly smooth one-dimensional (1D) data.

The scripts "fig*.py" reproduce all figures from the paper below, and all figures can be generated using the single script "run_all.py". These scripts use functions available in the module "nonuniform1d.py" to generate a variety of nonuniformly smooth, random 1D data. The figures are created using the "myplot.py" module, which provides a minor multi-panel figure customization based on the [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org) package.
